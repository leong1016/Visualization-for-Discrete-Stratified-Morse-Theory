\section{Accomplishments}
\begin{itemize}
\item Reading a refined OFF file describing a triangulation with the last digit being the function value.
\item Calculating the two sets: $U(\alpha)$ and $L(\alpha)$ and finding the violator criticals, non-violator criticals and non-criticals.
\item Drawing the triangulation with d3.js and mark violator criticals, non-violator criticals and non-criticals.
\item Creating an animation of removing the non-critical simplices to simplify the data.
\end{itemize}

\section{To-dos}
\begin{itemize}
\item Drawing arrows to denote non-scritical pairs.
\item Implementing Algorithm 2, a refined version of Algorithm 1.
\item Making comparisons among original data, data simplified by Algorithm 1 and data simplified by Algorithm2.
\end{itemize}

\section{Changes}
\begin{itemize}
\item No longer considering TTK plugin option for current course project.
\end{itemize}
